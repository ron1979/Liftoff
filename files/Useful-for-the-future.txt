setup for jason 

var str = 'I want to replace "this" and words, but not the one "here"';
str = str.replace(/"/g,"\\\"");
console.log(str);

becomes this:
I want to replace \"this\" and words, but not the one \"here\"

str.replace(/(\r\n\t|\n|\r\t)/gm,""); // remove all line breakers - to paste it in jason
